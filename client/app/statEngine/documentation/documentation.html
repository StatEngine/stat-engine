					<h4 id="overviewWhatIsStatengine" class="heavyheader mt-5">What is StatEngine?</h4>
					<p>
            StatEngine is a real-time open source data analytics and visualization platform built from the ground up for public safety
            organizations. StatEngine is built on powerful, best-of-breed, open source analytics and visualization tools. This means
            public safety organizations of all sizes can easily and cost-effectively exploit large volumes of complex, highly relevant,
             and impactful data sets.  StatEngine is currently funded by the
             <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/real-time-open-source-data-analytics-and-visualization-platform" target="_blank">
               Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program (PSIAP)</a>.
          </p>

					<h4 id="overviewUsingGuide" class="heavyheader mt-5">Using This Guide</h4>
					<p>This manual is intended for system administrators responsible for installing and managing StatEngine data. We’ve included a quickstart that will cover the majority of implementations, but also provided more detailed documentation that explains all the features and will help for more customized implementations.</p>

					<h4 id="overviewGetHelp" class="heavyheader mt-5">How to get help</h4>

					<h2>Getting Started</h2>

					<h4 id="gettingStartedConnectYourData" class="heavyheader mt-5">1. Connect Your Data</h4>
          <p>
            StatEngine integrates with common fire department data sources including data warehouses, Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems
            and Records Management Systems (RMS). Multiple approaches, listed below, can be used to securely send data to StatEngine.
            The department should review the various approaches and once the desired integration approach is identified, fill our our questionaire <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/WggWsVL3pcKpXt9G2" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>

					<strong>Spade</strong>
          <p>
            <a href="https://statengine.io/spade" target="_blank">Spade</a> can be run on your local network to read data from your local
            database(s) and send it to StatEngine. Spade can also be configured to run on your local network and watch a directory for
            CAD files and then push them to NFORS.
          </p>

          <strong> PulsePoint </strong>
          <p>
            If your department has an existing <a href="http://pulsepoint.org" target="_blank">PulsePoint</a> integration, you can leverage
            the same integration to send CAD data to StatEngine.
          </p>

					<strong> Linked Database </strong>
          <p>
            If you are able to push data to a database in our cloud environment, we can provide you with connection information to push data
            to a dedicated database we stand up for you. You can find more information on linking MSSQL databases
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/linked-servers/linked-servers-database-engine" target="_blank">here</a>.
            This approach minimizes the amount of software that needs to run on a department’s infrastructure, however it requires the local
            jurisdiction to setup and configure the linked database and synchronization logic.
          </p>

          <h4 id="gettingStartedVerifyYourData" class="heavyheader mt-5">2. Verify Your Data</h4>
          <p>
            Once StatEngine starts receiving data, we will work with you to identify missing or erroneous data.
            Often times we'll need details on missing apparatus types, battalion and district mappings to enrich your data to the fullest extent.
          </p>

          <h4 id="gettingStartedAccessYourData" class="heavyheader mt-5">3. Access Your Data</h4>
          <p>
            After data verfication, we will set you up with a customized dashboard so you can start exploring your data.
            Check out what's possible <a ng-click="scrollTo('#dashboardFeatures')">here</a>.
          </p>

          <h4 id="gettingStartedExloreYourData" class="heavyheader mt-5">4. Explore Your Data Even More</h4>
          <p>
            StatEngine has even more ways to add and enrich your data.  Explore plugins like adding weather, traffic, or directly tweeting stats to Twitter.

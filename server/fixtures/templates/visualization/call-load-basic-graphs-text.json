Departments protecting smaller populations will be more skewed to the left, while departments protecting larger poulations will be skewed to the right. This is because the larger your population, the more likely multiple incidents are going on _somewhere_.\\n\\n**The bottom graph** displays your department's response time to incoming incidents as a function of the number of calls in progress when these incidents come in. generally this graph will display more erratic behavior the farther to the right it goes because the number of incidents in each bin gets much, much smaller, as is shown by the top graph.\"},\"aggs\":[]}",

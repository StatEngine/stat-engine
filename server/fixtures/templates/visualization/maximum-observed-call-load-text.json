A map such as this supplies the historically observed \\\"worst case\\\" scenarios for each census tract, which, coupled with considerations of the department-level demand at these times, may aid in planning for and communicating reasoning behind \\\"worst case\\\" scenario incident response situations faced by your department.\\n\\nLikewise, **the heat map to the right** shows the highest observed number of incidents already in progress _when one more incident arrives_ for a given hour of day and day of week, again helping visualize how possible \\\"worst case\\\" scenarios for incident demand might look.\"},\"aggs\":[]}",

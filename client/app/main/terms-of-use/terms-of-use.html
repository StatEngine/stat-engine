            <strong>Introduction.</strong>
            <p>
              Stat Engine is a web-based tool to analyze and visualize emergency response data. These Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (collectively, “Terms”) govern your use of Stat Engine including all use, submissions, and purchases that you make. Stat Engine is
              provided by Prominent Edge LLC (“we” or “us”). In this Agreement, the term “you” means the person who (or the entity on whose behalf you are acting) is agreeing to these Terms. By using, subscribing, or registering for Stat Engine, you signify
              electronically your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not sign up or use Stat Engine.

            <strong>Updates.</strong>
            <p>
              These Terms are effective as of the date first written above. We may update these terms from time to time by posting such updated Terms to statengine.io or by providing email notice to you. Terms posted to statengine.io shall become effective upon posting.
              Terms provided via email (or via a link in an email) shall become effective upon sending by us. In the event of an update, by continuing to use Stat Engine you agree to be bound by any such updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must immediately
              stop using Stat Engine. We may change or discontinue any feature of Stat Engine at any time without notice.

              under your account for payment; and (iii) you will be responsible for such charges. YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR ALL AMOUNTS DUE TO US WITHOUT ADDITIONAL NOTICE OR CONSENT unless required otherwise by law. If we do
              not receive payment from your designated payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account made by you or anyone who uses your account. We may, in our discretion,
              post charges to your payment method individually or may aggregate your charges with other purchases you make on Stat Engine. You agree that any submissions you make for electronic purchases constitute your intent and agreement to be bound
              by the terms of and pay for such purchases.

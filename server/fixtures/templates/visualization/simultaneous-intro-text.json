Although it does not necessarily convey true loading on the apparatus deployment of the fire department, since any given incident can require between 1 (e.g. low priority EMS response) and a lot (e.g. high-rise building fire in a downtown area) of apparatus/personnel, it conveys the typical historical demand the department has faced in terms of number of incidents in progress at any given time and serves as a good indicator of loading.\\n\\n**Number of overlapping incidents** is a metric that provides another indicator of resource drain on the fire department. Although the number of units dedicated to a given incident can fluctuate with time, the number of overlapping incidents can provide another way to discuss commitment to incidents, since at least one apparatus with its associated personnel are committed until the incident is closed.\"},\"aggs\":[]}",
